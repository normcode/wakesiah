wakesiah: Process Group Membership
==================================

This project is a gossip-based membership service implemented in
Elixir.

It is personal research project and is not fit for any purpose.

If you want to learn with me, I welcome any contribution including
feedback, questions, issues, documentation, gifs, and code. You're
always free to email me.

Development Environment
-----------------------

There is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) configuration that
will provision a virtual machine for development purposes.

To create the development environment:

    $ vagrant up

Once the virtual machine is created and configured, you can login:

    $ vagrant ssh

You'll find the source code in `/vagrant` on the vm.
